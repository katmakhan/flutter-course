# Flutter Syllabus
Create your flutter projects by using the sample resources, and get your web/apk/ios builds right away

### Getting Started
```console
flutter create <project_name>
```

Copy the necessary resource files from the repo
```console
flutter build web
```

Run the build in an emulator or chrome or press `crtl`+`F5` for debubbing and run or just `F5` to run without debugger attached.
```console
flutter run
```
