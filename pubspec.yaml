# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/png_bg/
    - assets/png_logo/
    - assets/png_onboarding/
    - assets/png_onboarding2/
    - assets/svg_home/
    - assets/svg_logo/
    - assets/svg_other/
    - assets/svg_profile/


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/poppins_light.ttf
          weight: 200
        - asset: fonts/poppins_regular.ttf
          weight: 300  
        - asset: fonts/poppins_medium.ttf
          weight: 400  
        - asset: fonts/poppins_semibold.ttf
          weight: 500  
        - asset: fonts/poppins_bold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: fonts/poppins_black.ttf
          weight: 700 
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Roboto-Light.ttf
          weight: 300  
        - asset: fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf
